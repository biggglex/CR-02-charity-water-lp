                Clean water changes everything — but only if we make it possible.<br><br>
                Twelve-year-old Tarik Haftay walks to a river twice a day under the scorching 90-degree sun, carrying 40-pound jerry cans just to bring water home. It’s an hour-long round trip, and she does it all before heading to school — if there’s still time. Tarik’s story isn’t unique. Millions of girls around the world spend their childhoods walking for water instead of learning, playing, or dreaming. With your help, we can bring clean, safe water to communities like hers and give girls like Tarik the chance to thrive.
